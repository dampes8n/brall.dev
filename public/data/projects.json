        "description": "<p>Since I'd been working at the same place for almost 13 years – and recent events being what they are – I thought it was high time I built a new portfolio. My old portfolios and resumes were always very dramatic, pretentious, and over-the-top. I thought, Hell, might as well keep up the tradition.</p><p>I've been using AI in my processes for years now. See: <a href=\"#!/My-Stance-On-AI\">My Stance On AI</a>. But, ironically, considering where I work, perhaps, I haven't fully adopted AI vibe coding. I hadn't fully explored the limits. I've done some vibe coding here and there for small projects around the house, of course; I've seen people use it similarly for half-assed games and YouTube reactions. But is AI really up to the task of polishing off a whole project?</p><p>No. It isn't.</p><p>It is getting closer all the time, though. It can get you to the first 90%. But the second 90%? The polish phase? The refactoring and refinement? It not only needed handholding the whole way, but it could also have benefited dramatically from my stepping in to write code by hand.</p><p>I didn't step in, though. I persisted. This website was entirely vibe-coded. I didn't write a single line of it by hand. I came close in a few places; I'll detail them below, but in the end, I didn't hand-write anything. I sure-as-fuck wanted to.</p><h3>The Good</h3><p>At this point, vibe coding is how every project should start. Getting to that first 90% – <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninety%E2%80%93ninety_rule\">you know about the two 90%, right</a>? It is like the three sea-shells. Anyway. AI is astoundingly good at getting a prototype or even the baseline of a project together. For this portfolio, I went in with a plan. <a href=\"files/Plan.md\">Link to plan.md</a> And the majority of that plan ended up being built. Not all of it was kept; a lot of the ideas were dead ends, but that's how ideas work. Some of the flavors changed. Some of the design ideas didn't feel good in practice. Some elements weren't implemented due to time constraints.</p><p>AI sped up these parts of the process, and by the end of day one, the majority of the portfolio's structure was in place. The problem is that this is day five that I am writing this.</p><h3>The Bad</h3><p>Vibe coding can't do new. Any novel idea has to be explained to AI in excruciating detail. Often in pseudocode. Sometimes, by giving code snippets to get the point across. If you look around at the different flavors of this portfolio – down there in the footer, can't miss 'em – you'll see that there is more than one novel design technique employed therein.</p><p>The Video-based transitions in Terminally Ill and VHScary? Never seen that before. The 3D Scene backgrounds? Only ever seen that done on <a href=\"#!/projects/the-elder-scrolls-online\">The Elder Scrolls Online</a> (by me). Getting these techniques working was a pain. A doable pain that took me the closest I got to actually coding in the whole project, but it was achievable.</p><h3>The Ugly</h3><p>What AI couldn't do is code professionally. I constantly had to remind it to use the CSS variables we'd set up to make the flavor files easier and smaller. Some of the flavors are hundreds of lines of redundant CSS. I couldn't get it to clean up the code. If I asked it to fix a design issue, it would always add more code rather than remove it, even if eliminating code would be the obvious solution for a human. Does the <code>article p { margin: 0; }</code> override the base level p tag's margin? Better add that margin like this, right? <code>article p { margin: 0; margin-bottom: 1rem; }</code> That's better than realizing the zeroed margin is old and not doing anything. Exhausting.</p><p>In the end, this website is bloated and contains at least twice as much code as it should.</p><h3>A Light at the End of the Tunnel</h3><p>As bad as polishing is, it is all solvable. As these tools mature (in this case, Cursor), you'll see these issues go away. Now that I have built a finished, polished product without writing code, I can see how coding by hand is going to die out. Is that good? Once again, I'll point you to <a href=\"#!/My-Stance-On-AI\">my stance on AI</a> linked to above and in the main navigation.</p><h3>Hosting</h3><p>The site itself is hosted on an Ubuntu Server (minimal) server I built.</p>"

The designer I worked with, <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/person/1061958/david-campbell/\">David Campbell</a>, is top-notch. We worked hand in glove on the designs and had direct access to the game's art director, <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/person/3684/marc-hudgins/\">Marc Hudgins</a>.</p><p>From first learning about the game to the website going live, it was just about <strong>three months</strong>.</p><p>The Keen site is a masterpiece. We were so on the bleeding edge.</p><h3>Scrolling Stars (And Space Junk)</h3><p>The idea of scrolling stars was there from the start. Implementing it, though, was a different matter. It went through several versions, starting with layered backgrounds, moving to individual images, and finally becoming a WebGL canvas. With canvas, we gained much-needed performance, which ultimately meant we could have many more stars on screen and insert random space junk as well.</p><h3>Parallax Header</h3><p>The top of the page is constructed of 10ish layers, all individually parallaxing based on scroll and with css animations.</p><h3>All of the text is real text</h3><p>Ok, not the logo. But all the rest of it. I don't think we were the first to use text-shadows to stroke text. But I do believe we did it best. It perfectly matches the game, which doesn't use CSS.</p><h3>No, those aren't animated gifs.</h3><p><video controls style=\"border-radius: 8px; max-width: 100%; height: auto; display: block; margin: 0 auto;\"><source src=\"video/keen-card.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></p><p>The Card section features an animated sprite-sheet-based PNG. Not only does this animation play much more smoothly than a GIF (and pre-dates animated PNGs in the browser), but it features advanced options! This one has a fidget at the end that plays more rarely than the main animation sequence, and it plays randomly. This tech supports up to two fidgets per sheet. These were hand-assembled from the game's real animations by Marc.</p><p><img src=\"img/projects/lg-billie-flying-longer-2.png\" alt=\"Billie flying animation\" /></p><h3>Mouse-based 3D jiggle.</h3><p>Many of the sections are broken today, but they worked fine when the site was live. It is the browsers that have changed. You can still see this working more or less as intended in the cards section. This is a small 3D wiggle applied to the section based on how close the mouse is to the edges. Ok, for most sections it is a lot more than a \"little.\" You can fix it by moving the mouse to the center of the screen. You're welcome.</p><h3>Sparkles</h3><p>When sections fade in, they do so with sparkles that randomly appear with them and which spin and dance.</p><h3>Speedlines</h3><p>The Speedlines behind the sections wobble to and fro. They are built using the <a href=\"https://latex.net/efficient-seamless-tiled-backgrounds/\">Cicada Tile technique</a>.</p>"
