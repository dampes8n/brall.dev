I played Evoland II and discovered that my BBEG was in it. I don't know how she got there. She *can* open portals between universes. It doesn't seem like it, but I'm being completely serious. Here are my notes about her when she reveals herself as the BBEG to the group. She first met them in session 2, as the Mythomancer, a month before Evoland 2 was released.</p><p>\"The ceiling tiles melt away, the rails glowing, and a red-hot hole opens in the concrete above.
