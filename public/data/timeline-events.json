        "description": "We all showed up to play D&D, but the apocalypse happened instead. The DM was grabbed by a demon and dragged to Hell, monsters are flying around shooting lasers, and the only weapon anyone can find is a book. This campaign started big and got universal. By the end, one of the players had inherited godhood from Yahweh, another was a Jewish Disney Princess, and another went and learned to fight from Goku. The final battle featured Galactus and Unicron doing the DBZ fusion dance. You had to be there.<br>The BBEG was Ceres from Evoland 2; why yes, this campaign *did* start before that game came out, and yes, she already was the BBEG before it came out – no, I don't know how, it just happened that way. I played Evoland II and discovered that my BBEG was in it. I don't know how she got there. She *can* open portals between universes. It doesn't seem like it, but I'm being completely serious. Here are my notes about her when she reveals herself as the BBEG to the group. She first met them in session 2, as the Mythomancer, a month before Evoland 2 was released.<br>\"The ceiling tiles melt away, the rails glowing, and a red-hot hole opens in the concrete above. Wreathed in fire, Mytha descends from the floor above, her clothes burned away and her naked body ice blue and covered in black-lined etchings. She has two small black horns on either side of her bald head.\" Ice-blue-skinned portal-diving universe-hopping demon-girl.<br>I even named her Mytha when I played Evoland 2 for the first time. I just thought she looked similar; I didn't know who she was yet. When you name her in the game, you wouldn't know she can open portals in time and space.",
