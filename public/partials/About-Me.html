        <p>Hey, I'm Will Brall. Currently, I am the Lead Web Developer at ZeniMax Online Studios, a published author, and a well-regarded Dungeon Master (at least by my players). Code I wrote has been used by tens of millions of users. Words I've written have been read by hundreds of people. Games I've GMed have been played by dozens of players.</p>
        
        <p>My Web Development and UX Design career has seen me building experiences for The Elder Scrolls Online, the cancelled Commander Keen Mobile game, and the U.S. Army's flagship website. I even designed a game that was in their iOS App. And I started out making intranet sites for NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center.</p>
        
        <p>I wrote Magitism: The Force of Magic in 2022, a book about magical aliens crash-landing on Earth. Dale Arnold, the president of the Baltimore Science Fiction Society, said: "...I enjoyed reading this book more than I have enjoyed Hugo winners in the past."</p>
        
        <p>As a fan of TTRPGs, I've been lucky enough to hobnob with a bunch of D&D legends like Jeff Grubb, Lawrence Schick, Ed Stark, and Zeb Cook, as well as many other giants of the video game industry. Their influence has helped shape me into a world-class Game Master who has run games for many game designers.</p>
