### Magitism: The Force of Magic

[https://www.magitism.com](https://www.magitism.com)  
Magitism: The Force of Magic was conceived as an exploration of the non-binary aliens trope – an attempt to deconstruct what makes it harmful and to reimagine it as supportive instead. It explores themes such as: what it means to be intelligent; how sufficiently explained magic is indistinguishable from science; and how history is not created by great men, but by systemic forces that dominate culture. It is also about a friendship between two literally star-crossed dorks.

#### Dale Arnold Review \- June 4, 2024

⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐Bought this expecting modest \- Loved it  
“I bought this at the dealers room at Balticon because I always try to support new authors. I expected a decent work of course but **I enjoyed reading this book more than I have enjoyed Hugo winners in the past**. Magic as rules driven physics played as hard science fiction, the human spirit winning out in the end in a clever way. I read all the way through and it did not lag. The author's voice is good. Hope he writes more.”  
—  Dale Arnold, President of the Baltimore Science Fiction Society

#### Published \- December 18th, 2022

For the book's release, I did a 24-hour Twitch stream. I don’t expect you to watch the VODs.

Elevator Pitches:

* Magical aliens crash-land on Earth; Humanity has to science the shit out of the magic to get them back into space.  
* Hail Mary meets Mistborn, crash-landing in Philadelphia.

### The Bronze Coin

#### Closed \- Early 2014

It turned out that my research was flawed. I’d expected one level of engagement from the people I had interviewed outside game stores, but the reality was 1/10th of what the study indicated. This made the project unsustainable. If I’d opened The Bronze Coin 6-7 years later than I did, I would have missed the pandemic and landed right in the sweet spot of explosive growth in Pro-DMing. Live and learn. Expensive mistake, though.

#### Opened \- July 2013

\[Insert Bronze Coin Logo\]  
I opened The Bronze Coin, a role-playing guildhall, after a lot of market research. Pro-DMing was just starting, but had not blossomed as it would during the pandemic. The year+ it operated was tons of fun and work. I met a lot of people who would go on to be part of my life to this day, and many who drifted in pleasantly for years before moving on.

I led the technological vision for Army.mil, including My.Army.mil and the CORE Content Management System that drove them. We were a small (\<20) team, which allowed me to implement many of the core systems myself. The rest of our development team, along with our content and design teams, then used these APIs and tools to support the day-to-day operations of our contract.

Tools I've architected and built have reduced not only our own costs but the costs of over 1000 Public Affairs Officers using CORE and their 100+ websites. Saving the Army millions in hosting, developer, and designer costs annually.

Using these systems ourselves, we not only maintained Army.mil with this small team of content editors, designers, and developers, but also managed our many Feature Sites. Additionally, we were able to create new feature sites, complete with radically different designs and automatic content from CORE, on very short notice.

### TTRPGs

#### Isle of Glass Statues II \- July 21, 2024 \- July 27, 2024

D\&D 5E  
This game was at Dan Wells, Game Night Getaway ‘24. Dan is the other author on Brandon Sanderson’s Intentionally Blank podcast.

The game went exceptionally well. There were 16 players in total over the course of the week, and I got in around 50 hours of play time. They solved the island on the final day.

#### Halfling Baked \- March 2023 \- Present

D\&D 5E  
Cherry Grass-seed left his band, the Warlocks, over 100 years ago. He’s now 270 years old and resolved to go on one last hurrah. The Halfling Bard has hired a half-dozen hale and hearty music lovers (you) as his road crew and loaded up the wagons for the final time.

#### Repocalypse (Comedy of Justice II) \- July 2021 \- Mid 2023

D\&D 5E and PbtA  
A continuation of Comedy of Justice I with new players \- still all playing themselves. Ceres survived the first campaign by living inside me.

#### Crumblewood \- July 2021 \- August 2021

D\&D 5E and Humblewood  
A zombie apocalypse in the world of Humblewood. Played outside in a wedding tent in a field.

#### Papaku Vai \- July 2019 \- Mid 2020

D\&D 5E  
A vacation island paradise with a dark undercurrent.

#### Truugahn II \- April 2018 \- Oct 12, 2019

D\&D 5E  
A continuation of my first campaign, Truugahn turned out to secretly be the old god of death, trying to reclaim his domain.

#### Isle of Glass Statues \- October 2016 \- Mid 2017

D\&D 5E  
[https://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/65krnk/isle\_of\_glass\_statues\_free\_hardcore\_multigroup\_5e/](https://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/65krnk/isle_of_glass_statues_free_hardcore_multigroup_5e/)  
Ultimately, this game had 15 players across four groups. This is the foundation for things to come. Washed up on a deserted island, shifting between obsidian statues and corporal form, players have to survive extreme hostility on an ever-changing landscape.

#### Bonewall \- Mid 2014 \- October 2016 

D\&D 5E  
What happens if the party kills a purple worm on day one, one that had a bellyache from eating through a vault filled with the thieves' guild’s fortune?

#### Comedy of Justice \- July 2015 \- Mid 2016

D\&D 5E  
We all showed up to play D\&D, but the apocalypse happened instead. The DM was grabbed by a demon and dragged to Hell, monsters are flying around shooting lasers, and the only weapon anyone can find is a book. This campaign started big and got universal. By the end, one of the players had inherited godhood from Yahweh, another was a Jewish Disney Princess, and another went and learned to fight from Goku. The final battle featured Galactus and Unicron doing the DBZ fusion dance. You had to be there.

The BBEG was Ceres from Evoland 2; why yes, this campaign *did* start before that game came out, and yes, she already was the BBEG before it came out – no, I don’t know how, it just happened that way. I played Evoland II and discovered that my BBEG was in it. I don’t know how she got there. She *can* open portals between universes. It doesn’t seem like it, but I’m being completely serious. Here are my notes about her when she reveals herself as the BBEG to the group. She first met them in session 2, as the Mythomancer, a month before Evoland 2 was released.

“The ceiling tiles melt away, the rails glowing, and a red-hot hole opens in the concrete above. Wreathed in fire, Mytha descends from the floor above, her clothes burned away and her naked body ice blue and covered in black-lined etchings. She has two small black horns on either side of her bald head.” Ice-blue-skinned portal-diving universe-hopping demon-girl.

\[Insert picture of Ceres\]

I even named her Mytha when I played Evoland 2 for the first time. I just thought she looked similar; I didn’t know who she was yet. When you name her in the game, you wouldn’t know she can open portals in time and space.

#### Truugahn \- 2011 \- 2014

D\&D 4E  
My first campaign in adulthood was after a long gap since childhood. Though only a little longer than other campaigns, it is deceptive because, unlike the 2-3 hour sessions that happen today, these were often 8-12-hour marathons. We covered in a single session what might be a month’s worth of games today. All in all, it was pretty standard fantasy. However, we were on a version of Earth in the deep future. Oh, and some god had cut Earth in half, and the two halves kept their shape magically. (Turns out if you did that, all the water would rush into two big oceans – one on the flat side, and one on the curved side.)
